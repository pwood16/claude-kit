# Prime Agent with Project Context

You MUST complete the following steps immediately before doing anything else.

## Step 1: Explore project file structure

Use `Bash` to run `git ls-files` to see all tracked files in the repository.

## Step 2: Find and read all README files

Use `Glob` to find all README.md files in the project, then use `Read` to read each one.

## Step 3: Report your understanding

After completing steps 1 and 2, you MUST report a brief summary to the user including:
- Project purpose and goals
- Directory structure and organization
- Key components and how they relate
- Any important patterns or conventions you noticed

Do this NOW.
