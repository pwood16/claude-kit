# Progress Log for test-flags-spec
# Started: 2026-02-01 08:08:51


### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 08:08:51

**Issue Encountered:** The required spec file `test-flags-spec.md` does not exist in the repository.

**Investigation:**
- Checked for the file at `/Users/cabewaldrop/dev/claude-kit/test-flags-spec.md` - not found
- Searched for any flag-related spec files - none found
- Reviewed git history - commit 5528e05 referenced "test-flag-spec" but only modified the ralph-loop script and progress file, no spec file was created
- The progress file `test-flags-spec-progress.txt` exists but is empty

**Cannot proceed:** The Ralph Loop requires a spec file with tasks to complete. Without `test-flags-spec.md`, there are no tasks to implement.

**Status:** Blocked - missing spec file
Status: Completed

### Iteration 2 - 2026-02-01 08:09:44

**Issue Encountered:** The required spec file `test-flags-spec.md` still does not exist in the repository.

**Investigation:**
- Verified that `test-flags-spec.md` does not exist in the project
- Checked git history - the file was never created
- Iteration 1 already identified this as a blocker

**Root Cause:** The Ralph Loop cannot operate without a spec file that defines the tasks to be completed. The spec file `test-flags-spec.md` must be created with:
1. A description of the feature
2. A "Step by Step Tasks" section with h3 headings for each task
3. Bullet points under each task describing what needs to be done

**Cannot proceed:** Without the spec file, there are no tasks to implement.

**Status:** Blocked - missing spec file `test-flags-spec.md`

### Iteration 3 - 2026-02-01 (current iteration)
Status: Completed
