### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 08:15:36

**Tasks Completed:**
- Created scripts/goodbye.py with proper uv script structure
- Implemented goodbye() function that prints 'Goodbye World'
- Added CLI interface with argparse following hello.py pattern
- Made script executable with chmod +x
- Ran all validation commands successfully

**Implementation Details:**
- Created goodbye.py following the exact pattern from hello.py
- Used identical structure: shebang, uv script block, module docstring, function with docstring, argparse CLI, main block
- Script supports three execution methods: python3, direct execution, and uv run --script
- All validation commands passed:
  * Script creation verified
  * Executable permissions confirmed
  * Python syntax validation passed
  * Help output works correctly
  * Output "Goodbye World" verified via python3, direct execution, and uv
  * No regression - hello.py still works correctly

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - implementation was straightforward following the hello.py template

**Learnings:**
- The uv script pattern with inline dependencies block is consistent across project
- Following existing patterns makes implementation quick and error-free
- All validation commands passed on first try, confirming good pattern matching
- The script structure is very clean: shebang -> deps -> docstring -> imports -> function -> main -> entry point

**Status:**
ALL TASKS COMPLETE - All 5 tasks from the spec have been implemented and validated successfully.
Status: Completed
