This should behave the same as the feature loop script running review, diagnosing whether the findings are real or just false positives, and then taking action to fix until acr returns only false positives or exits succesfully. Remember we want to run with the --local -a claude -s claude -r 5 flags and add comments that explain false positives in each iteration. ",
