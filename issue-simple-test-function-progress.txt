### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 08:18:30

**Task Completed:** Create the test.py script structure

**Actions Taken:**
- Created `/Users/cabewaldrop/dev/claude-kit/scripts/test.py` with the proper shebang `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`
- Added inline uv script dependencies block with `requires-python = ">=3.10"` and empty dependencies array
- Added comprehensive module docstring explaining the script's purpose and usage examples
- Followed the pattern established by hello.py and goodbye.py scripts
- Added skeleton for `test()` function and `main()` function with argument parser
- Included `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

**Learnings:**
- The project follows a consistent pattern for utility scripts using the uv inline script format
- The shebang pattern is `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` with the inline metadata block immediately following
- All scripts include argparse even for simple cases, maintaining consistency
- Module docstrings include multiple usage examples showing different invocation methods

**Next Task:** Implement the test function with assertions and test logic
Status: Completed

Iteration 1 Summary - 2026-02-01 08:19:05
======================================================================

Task: Create the test.py script structure

Status: ✓ Complete

Files changed: 1
  Added (1):
    + scripts/test.py

Exit status: Success

Progress: 1 of 5 tasks complete

======================================================================

### Iteration 2 - 2026-02-01 08:19:07

**Task Completed:** Implement the test function

**Actions Taken:**
- Implemented the `test()` function with a verbose parameter (defaults to False)
- Added test cases for arithmetic (1 + 1 == 2), string comparison ('test' == 'test'), boolean logic (True and True == True), and list operations ([1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3])
- Implemented test tracking using a list of tuples containing (description, lambda test function)
- Added pass/fail counting with try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions
- Implemented clear formatted output showing results summary with separators
- Modified return type from None to bool to indicate overall test success
- Updated main() function to accept --verbose/-v flag via argparse
- Added sys.exit() call with exit code 0 for success, 1 for failure
- Verified all tests pass and help/verbose flags work correctly

**Learnings:**
- Using lambda functions for test assertions provides a clean, declarative test definition pattern
- The verbose flag pattern allows for both concise and detailed output modes
- Using Unicode checkmarks (✓/✗) makes test results more readable in terminal output
- Proper exit code handling (0 for success, 1 for failure) is essential for CLI tools
- Test execution in a try-catch block ensures graceful error handling for individual tests

**Next Task:** Add CLI interface (already completed as part of this implementation)
Status: Completed

======================================================================
Iteration 2 Summary - 2026-02-01
======================================================================

Task: Implement the test function

Status: ✓ Complete

Files changed: 2
  Modified (2):
    ~ scripts/test.py (added test implementation with verbose support)
    ~ specs/issue-simple-test-function.md (marked task as complete)

Exit status: Success

Progress: 2 of 5 tasks complete

======================================================================

### Iteration 3 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Add CLI interface

**Actions Taken:**
- Verified that CLI interface was already implemented during task 2
- Confirmed argparse module is used with ArgumentParser
- Confirmed --help flag works and shows usage information
- Confirmed --verbose/-v flag works for detailed output
- Confirmed main() function exists and calls test() with appropriate parameters
- Confirmed `if __name__ == "__main__":` block exists and invokes main()
- Confirmed exit code is set based on test results (0 for success, 1 for failure via sys.exit())

**Learnings:**
- Tasks can sometimes be completed as part of related work, especially when they're tightly coupled
- The CLI interface requirements were naturally fulfilled while implementing the test function itself
- All CLI requirements from the spec are satisfied by the current implementation

**Next Task:** Make the script executable
Status: Completed

======================================================================
Iteration 3 Summary - 2026-02-01
======================================================================

Task: Add CLI interface

Status: ✓ Complete (already implemented in iteration 2)

Files changed: 1
  Modified (1):
    ~ specs/issue-simple-test-function.md (marked task as complete)

Exit status: Success

Progress: 3 of 5 tasks complete

======================================================================

### Iteration 4 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Make the script executable

**Actions Taken:**
- Added executable permissions to scripts/test.py using `chmod +x`
- Verified permissions are set correctly (shows -rwxr-xr-x)
- Tested direct execution with `./scripts/test.py` - works correctly
- Confirmed the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` allows direct execution

**Learnings:**
- The uv shebang pattern allows scripts to be directly executable while still being compatible with the uv runtime
- Executable permissions (chmod +x) are necessary for direct script execution via ./
- The script now supports all three execution methods: python3, direct ./, and uv run --script

**Next Task:** Run validation commands
Status: Completed

### Iteration 5 - 2026-02-01

**Task Completed:** Run validation commands

**Actions Taken:**
- Executed all validation commands from the spec with zero errors:
  ✓ `ls -la scripts/test.py` - confirmed script exists with correct permissions
  ✓ `test -x scripts/test.py` - confirmed script is executable
  ✓ `python3 -m py_compile scripts/test.py` - confirmed valid Python syntax
  ✓ `python3 scripts/test.py --help` - confirmed help output works
  ✓ `python3 scripts/test.py` - confirmed tests run and pass
  ✓ `./scripts/test.py` - confirmed direct execution works
  ✓ `uv run --script scripts/test.py` - confirmed uv compatibility
  ✓ `python3 scripts/test.py --verbose` - confirmed verbose output works
  ✓ Exit code verification - confirmed exit code 0 on success

**Learnings:**
- All validation commands passed on first attempt, indicating proper implementation
- The script successfully supports all three execution methods (python3, direct ./, uv)
- Exit codes work correctly (0 for success)
- Help and verbose flags function as expected
- The implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria from the spec

**Next Task:** None - all tasks complete
