### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 08:18:30

**Task Completed:** Create the test.py script structure

**Actions Taken:**
- Created `/Users/cabewaldrop/dev/claude-kit/scripts/test.py` with the proper shebang `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`
- Added inline uv script dependencies block with `requires-python = ">=3.10"` and empty dependencies array
- Added comprehensive module docstring explaining the script's purpose and usage examples
- Followed the pattern established by hello.py and goodbye.py scripts
- Added skeleton for `test()` function and `main()` function with argument parser
- Included `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

**Learnings:**
- The project follows a consistent pattern for utility scripts using the uv inline script format
- The shebang pattern is `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` with the inline metadata block immediately following
- All scripts include argparse even for simple cases, maintaining consistency
- Module docstrings include multiple usage examples showing different invocation methods

**Next Task:** Implement the test function with assertions and test logic
Status: Completed
