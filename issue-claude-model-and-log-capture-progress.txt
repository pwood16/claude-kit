### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 09:23:37

**Task Completed:** Create Shared Logging Infrastructure

**What was done:**
1. Created `plugins/spawn/lib/` directory structure
2. Implemented `plugins/spawn/lib/logger.py` with comprehensive `StructuredLogger` class:
   - JSON-based logging (JSONL format - one JSON object per line)
   - Core methods: `log_event()`, `log_iteration_start()`, `log_iteration_end()`, `log_command()`, `log_error()`
   - Automatic timestamp generation in ISO 8601 format
   - Elapsed time tracking from logger initialization
   - Context manager support (`timing_context()`) for automatic duration tracking
   - Thread-safe file writing using threading.Lock
   - Output truncation for large command outputs (>1MB)
   - Configuration snapshot logging capability
   - Unicode handling
3. Created comprehensive unit tests in `plugins/spawn/lib/test_logger.py`:
   - 16 test cases covering all core functionality
   - Tests for thread safety with concurrent writes
   - Tests for large output truncation
   - Tests for timing context manager (success and exception paths)
   - Tests for unicode handling
   - All tests pass successfully
4. Created `plugins/spawn/lib/__init__.py` to make it a proper Python package
5. Copied logger files to `plugins/sdlc/lib/` (used copy instead of symlink for simplicity)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used JSONL format (one JSON object per line) for easy streaming and parsing with tools like jq
- Implemented automatic output truncation at 1MB to prevent memory issues with large command outputs
- Used threading.Lock for thread-safe writes to support potential concurrent usage
- Added both timestamp and elapsed time to each event for flexible time analysis
- Created context manager for timing blocks to ensure duration is always captured even on exceptions
- Used Path objects from pathlib for cross-platform file operations
- Added `ensure_ascii=False` to json.dump to properly handle unicode characters

**Issues Encountered:**
- Initial test tearDown had an issue with nested directory cleanup (test_create_parent_directories)
- Fixed by importing shutil and using shutil.rmtree() instead of os.rmdir() to handle nested directories

**Testing Results:**
- All 16 unit tests pass successfully
- Test coverage includes: initialization, event logging, iteration logging, command logging, error logging, timing contexts, configuration logging, thread safety, unicode handling, and edge cases

**Next Steps:**
The logging infrastructure is now complete and ready to be integrated into ralph-loop and feature-loop scripts. The next task is to extend the configuration system to support the model parameter.

### Iteration 2 - 2026-02-01 09:26:52

**Task Completed:** Extend Configuration System

**What was done:**
1. Updated `.claude-kit.example` file to include model field in both `feature_loop` and `ralph_loop` sections:
   - Added `"model": "claude"` to feature_loop configuration
   - Added new `ralph_loop` section with `"model": "claude"` field
   - This provides clear documentation for users on how to configure model selection

2. Extended feature-loop configuration validation in `plugins/sdlc/scripts/feature-loop`:
   - Added validation for `feature_loop.model` field (must be non-empty string)
   - Added validation for `ralph_loop.model` field (must be non-empty string)
   - Updated `validate_config()` to return three-tuple: (feature_loop_config, acr_config, ralph_loop_config)
   - Added validation for ralph_loop config section as dict type

3. Updated configuration loading in feature-loop:
   - Modified `load_configuration()` to return ralph_loop_config as third tuple element
   - Updated main() to extract `default_model` from feature_loop_config with fallback to "claude"
   - Updated verbose logging to include model configuration
   - Updated all call sites to handle three-tuple return value

4. Added comprehensive TypedDict type hints:
   - Created `FeatureLoopConfig` TypedDict with fields: model, max_implement_iterations, max_review_iterations, skip_review, verbose
   - Created `RalphLoopConfig` TypedDict with field: model
   - Created `ACRConfig` TypedDict with field: num_reviewers
   - Used `total=False` to make all fields optional (supporting partial configs)
   - Updated function signatures for `validate_config()` and `load_configuration()` to use these types

5. Updated spec file to mark task as complete:
   - Added `**Status:** complete` line after "### Extend Configuration System" heading

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used `total=False` in TypedDict definitions to allow partial configurations (all fields optional)
- Maintained backwards compatibility by keeping "claude" as the default model when not configured
- Added validation to ensure model values are non-empty strings (prevents configuration errors)
- Separated ralph_loop config as its own section (not nested under feature_loop) for clarity
- Made ralph_loop_config available throughout feature-loop for future integration with ralph-loop invocations

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - implementation was straightforward

**Testing Considerations:**
- Configuration loading should now properly parse and validate model fields
- Type hints will help catch configuration errors at development time
- Defaults ensure backwards compatibility when model is not specified
- Validation prevents empty or invalid model strings

**Next Steps:**
The configuration system now supports model selection for both feature-loop and ralph-loop. The next task is to update ralph-loop CLI arguments to accept --model and --log parameters.

======================================================================

### Iteration 3 - 2026-02-01 09:29:44

**Task Completed:** Update ralph-loop CLI Arguments

**What was done:**
1. Added `--model` argument to `parse_arguments()` function in `plugins/spawn/scripts/ralph-loop.py`:
   - Type: str
   - Default: "claude"
   - Help text: "Model to use for agent invocations (default: claude)"
   - Positioned after the `--completion-promise` argument

2. Added `--log` / `--log-file` argument to `parse_arguments()`:
   - Accepts both `--log` and `--log-file` as aliases (using dest="log_file")
   - Type: str
   - Default: None (optional parameter)
   - Help text: "Path to log file for detailed execution capture (optional)"
   - This allows users to optionally capture detailed logs for debugging

3. Updated the module docstring to include the new parameters in the usage section:
   - Added `[--model MODEL]` and `[--log FILE]` to usage line
   - Added example showing both new parameters: `ralph-loop --spec specs/feature.md --model claude --log /tmp/ralph.log`

4. Updated the argument parser's epilog with the new example:
   - Added the same comprehensive example to the epilog section
   - Maintains consistency between docstring and help output

5. Updated spec file to mark task as complete:
   - Added `**Status:** complete` line after "### Update ralph-loop CLI Arguments" heading

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used both `--log` and `--log-file` as aliases to provide flexibility for users (some prefer shorter flags, others prefer explicit names)
- Set model default to "claude" to maintain backwards compatibility - existing scripts will work without modification
- Made log file optional (default None) so logging is opt-in only when needed
- Positioned new arguments after existing ones to maintain backwards compatibility in any scripts that use positional-style arg construction
- Used clear, descriptive help text for both arguments

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - implementation was straightforward

**Testing Considerations:**
- The new arguments are now available in the CLI interface
- Users can run `ralph-loop.py --help` to see the new parameters
- The arguments will be accessible via `args.model` and `args.log_file` in the script
- Still need to integrate these parameters into the actual execution logic in subsequent tasks

**Next Steps:**
The ralph-loop CLI now accepts model and log file parameters. The next task is to update feature-loop CLI arguments with the same parameters, followed by integrating these parameters into the actual execution logic of both scripts.

======================================================================

### Iteration 4 - 2026-02-01 09:30:58

**Task Completed:** Update feature-loop CLI Arguments

**What was done:**
1. Added `--model` argument to the argument parser in `plugins/sdlc/scripts/feature-loop` (after line 1186):
   - Type: str
   - Default: Uses `default_model` from configuration (which defaults to "claude")
   - Help text: "Model to use for agent invocations (default: {default_model})"
   - Integrates seamlessly with existing configuration system

2. Added `--log` / `--log-file` argument to the argument parser:
   - Accepts both `--log` and `--log-file` as aliases (using dest="log_file")
   - Type: str
   - Default: None (optional parameter)
   - Help text: "Path to log file for detailed execution capture (optional)"
   - Makes logging opt-in, only when users explicitly need it

3. Updated the epilog section with a comprehensive example:
   - Added example: `%(prog)s "Add API endpoint" --model claude --log /tmp/feature.log`
   - Shows both new parameters in action
   - Maintains consistency with existing examples

4. Updated spec file to mark task as complete:
   - Added `**Status:** complete` line after "### Update feature-loop CLI Arguments" heading

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Positioned new arguments after `--num-reviewers` to keep related arguments together
- Used `default_model` from configuration system for `--model` default, ensuring CLI args override config
- Made both `--log` and `--log-file` available as aliases for flexibility (matches ralph-loop implementation)
- Log file is optional (None by default) to maintain backwards compatibility
- Help text dynamically includes the actual default value from configuration
- Added practical example showing both parameters together in a realistic use case

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - implementation was straightforward and followed the established pattern from ralph-loop

**Testing Considerations:**
- The new arguments are now available in the CLI interface
- Users can run `feature-loop --help` to see the new parameters
- The arguments will be accessible via `args.model` and `args.log_file` in the script
- Model default respects configuration precedence (CLI > config > "claude")
- Still need to integrate these parameters into the actual execution logic in subsequent tasks

**Next Steps:**
Both ralph-loop and feature-loop now have CLI support for model and log file parameters. The next task is to integrate logging in ralph-loop by importing the StructuredLogger and updating the execution functions to use the new parameters.

### Iteration 5 - 2026-02-01 09:31:58

**Task Completed:** Integrate Logging in ralph-loop

**What was done:**
1. Added import for `StructuredLogger` from `lib.logger` with fallback import logic:
   - First tries `from lib.logger import StructuredLogger`
   - Falls back to adding lib directory to sys.path and importing directly
   - This ensures the script can find the logger module regardless of how it's invoked

2. Updated `run_claude_iteration()` function signature and implementation:
   - Added `model` parameter (default: "claude") to accept configurable model
   - Added optional `logger` parameter (default: None) for structured logging
   - Changed command construction from hardcoded `["claude", ...]` to `[model, ...]`
   - Added timing tracking with `start_time` and `duration` calculation
   - Added command execution start logging (when logger is enabled)
   - Added command execution completion logging with full output, exit code, and duration
   - Added exception handling with error logging
   - Wrapped command execution in try-except block to log errors with full context

3. Updated `run_ralph_loop()` function to initialize and use logger:
   - Extracted `model` and `log_file` from args at function start
   - Added logger initialization when `log_file` is provided:
     - Creates StructuredLogger instance
     - Logs initialization message
     - Handles initialization errors gracefully with warning (continues without logging)
   - Added error logging for spec format and validation errors
   - Added configuration snapshot logging with all run parameters
   - Updated header output to display model and log file (when enabled)
   - Added logging at key loop events:
     - Max iterations reached
     - Iteration start with pending count
     - All tasks complete
     - Pending count for each iteration
     - Iteration end (success or failure) with duration
     - Completion promise detection
     - Exception handling during iteration
     - Ralph loop complete with final statistics
   - Added logger.close() call at end of function to write final metadata
   - Updated `run_claude_iteration()` call site to pass `model` and `logger` parameters

4. Enhanced iteration loop with comprehensive logging:
   - Log iteration start before checking completion status
   - Log pending task count after computing it
   - Track iteration duration with timing
   - Log successful iterations with duration
   - Log failed iterations with exit code and duration
   - Log exceptions with full context and duration
   - All logging is conditional (only when logger is enabled)

5. Marked task as complete in spec file:
   - Added `**Status:** complete` line after "### Integrate Logging in ralph-loop" heading

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used flexible import mechanism to support different invocation methods (direct script run vs module import)
- Made all logging conditional (only when logger is provided) to maintain backwards compatibility
- Changed hardcoded "claude" to use model parameter throughout command construction
- Log command execution at both start and end for complete trace
- Captured and logged full command output (with truncation in logger for large outputs)
- Added exception handling to log errors without breaking execution flow
- Track iteration duration separately from command duration for complete performance metrics
- Log configuration snapshot at startup for reproducibility
- Close logger at end to write final metadata (total duration, success status)

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - implementation was straightforward following the established logger API

**Testing Considerations:**
- The model parameter now flows through to the actual claude CLI invocation
- Logger captures all key events when enabled
- Backwards compatibility maintained - works without --log parameter
- Exception handling ensures errors are logged without breaking the loop
- Configuration snapshot enables reproducing runs from logs
- Timing data enables performance analysis

**Verification:**
The integration is complete and ready for testing. Users can now run:
```bash
ralph-loop.py --spec specs/test.md --model claude --log /tmp/ralph.log
```

The log file will contain JSONL-formatted events including:
- Configuration snapshot
- Iteration start/end with durations
- Full command executions with outputs
- Error details with context
- Final completion status

**Next Steps:**
The ralph-loop logging integration is complete. The next task is to integrate logging in feature-loop, following a similar pattern.

### Iteration 6 - 2026-02-01 09:34:20

**Task Completed:** Integrate Logging in feature-loop

**What was done:**
1. Added import for `StructuredLogger` from `lib.logger` with fallback import logic (similar to ralph-loop):
   - First tries `from lib.logger import StructuredLogger`
   - Falls back to adding lib directory to sys.path and importing directly
   - Sets StructuredLogger to None if not available (graceful degradation)

2. Initialized logger in `main()` function when `--log` parameter is provided:
   - Creates logger right after argument parsing, before printing header
   - Logs initialization event with feature prompt
   - Added error handling - warns but continues without logging if initialization fails
   - Added model and log file to CONFIG output
   - Logs configuration snapshot with all run parameters (feature_prompt, model, max iterations, skip_review, etc.)
   - Added logger.close() at end of main() to finalize logging

3. Updated `run_feature_plan()` function to accept and use logger and model parameters:
   - Added `logger: Optional[Any] = None` and `model: str = "claude"` parameters
   - Changed command construction from hardcoded `["claude", ...]` to `[model, ...]`
   - Added logging for planning_start event
   - Added command execution logging (start and completion with output, exit code, duration)
   - Added error logging for planning failures
   - Added planning_complete event with duration
   - Updated call site in main() to pass logger and model parameters

4. Updated `triage_and_fix_issues()` function to accept and use logger and model parameters:
   - Added `logger: Optional[Any] = None` and `model: str = "claude"` parameters
   - Changed command construction from hardcoded `["claude", ...]` to `[model, ...]`
   - Added logging for triage_start event with review output length
   - Added command execution logging with timing
   - Added error logging for triage failures
   - Added triage_complete event with duration
   - Updated call site to pass logger and model parameters

5. Updated `run_implement()` function to accept and use logger and model parameters:
   - Added `logger: Optional[Any] = None`, `model: str = "claude"`, and `log_file: Optional[str] = None` parameters
   - Added logging for implementation_start event
   - Modified ralph-loop command to include `--model` parameter
   - Added `--log` parameter when log_file is provided (creates separate ralph-loop log with "-ralph" suffix)
   - Added command execution logging
   - Added implementation_complete event with exit code and duration
   - Added error logging if ralph-loop script not found
   - Updated call site in main() to pass logger, model, and log_file parameters

6. Marked task as complete in spec file:
   - Added `**Status:** complete` line after "### Integrate Logging in feature-loop" heading

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used consistent import pattern from ralph-loop for StructuredLogger
- Made all logging conditional (only when logger is provided) to maintain backwards compatibility
- Changed hardcoded "claude" to use model parameter throughout all command constructions
- Added comprehensive logging at key workflow phases: planning, implementation, triage
- Captured timing data for all major operations (planning, implementation, triage)
- Created separate log file for ralph-loop (with "-ralph" suffix) to distinguish logs
- Passed model parameter to ralph-loop so it uses the same model consistently
- Added logger.close() at end to finalize logging with metadata
- Logged configuration snapshot at startup for reproducibility

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - implementation followed established patterns from ralph-loop integration

**Testing Considerations:**
- The model parameter now flows through all Claude CLI invocations (planning and triage)
- Ralph-loop receives model parameter and creates separate log file
- Logger captures all key workflow events when enabled
- Backwards compatibility maintained - works without --log parameter
- Configuration snapshot enables reproducing runs from logs
- Timing data enables performance analysis across all phases

**Verification:**
The integration is complete and ready for testing. Users can now run:
```bash
feature-loop "Add feature" --model claude --log /tmp/feature.log
```

The log file will contain JSONL-formatted events including:
- Configuration snapshot
- Planning phase with command execution and timing
- Implementation phase (delegated to ralph-loop with separate log)
- Review and triage phases with command executions and timing
- Error details with context for any failures
- Final completion status

Ralph-loop will create a separate log file at `/tmp/feature-ralph.log` with its detailed iteration logs.

   - Added `--model` and `--log` / `--log-file` CLI arguments to argument parser
   - Updated docstring and epilog with examples showing new parameters
   - Added import for StructuredLogger with fallback error handling
   
2. Updated `run_claude_iteration()` function in ralph-loop:
   - Added `model` parameter (default: "claude") to accept configurable model
   - Added optional `logger` parameter (default: None) for structured logging
   - Replaced hardcoded `["claude", ...]` with `[model, ...]` in command construction

     - All tasks complete
     - Iteration start with pending count
     - Iteration end (success or failure) with duration
     - Completion promise detection
   - Added logger.close() call at end of function to write final metadata
   - Updated `run_claude_iteration()` call site to pass `model` and `logger` parameters

4. Marked task as complete in spec file by adding `**Status:** complete` line

**Key Design Decisions:**
- The ralph-loop script (without .py extension) is the actual one used by feature-loop, not ralph-loop.py
- Both files exist but only ralph-loop (without extension) is referenced in feature-loop's find_ralph_loop_script()
- Used flexible import mechanism to support different invocation methods (direct script run vs module import)
- Made all logging conditional (only when logger is provided) to maintain backwards compatibility
- Changed hardcoded "claude" to use model parameter throughout command construction
- Log command execution at both start and end for complete trace
- Captured and logged full command output (with truncation in logger for large outputs)
- Added exception handling to log errors without breaking execution flow
- Track iteration duration separately from command duration for complete performance metrics
- Log configuration snapshot at startup for reproducibility
- Close logger at end to write final metadata (total duration, success status)

**Issues Encountered:**

- Discovered by searching for hardcoded "claude" strings and finding one in the ralph-loop (without .py) file
- Verified by checking feature-loop's find_ralph_loop_script() function which looks for "ralph-loop" not "ralph-loop.py"

**Testing Considerations:**
- The model parameter now flows through to the actual claude CLI invocation
- Logger captures all key events when enabled
- Backwards compatibility maintained - works without --log parameter
- Exception handling ensures errors are logged without breaking the loop
- Configuration snapshot enables reproducing runs from logs
- Timing data enables performance analysis

**Verification:**
The integration is complete and ready for testing. Users can now run:
```bash
ralph-loop --spec specs/test.md --model claude --log /tmp/ralph.log
```

The log file will contain JSONL-formatted events including:
- Configuration snapshot
- Iteration start/end with durations
- Full command executions with outputs
- Error details with context
- Final completion status

**Next Steps:**
All Claude CLI invocations have been updated to use the model parameter. No hardcoded "claude" strings remain in command construction. The next task is to add documentation.

### Iteration 8 - 2026-02-01 09:43:50

**Task Completed:** Add Documentation

**What was done:**
1. Updated `plugins/spawn/README.md` with comprehensive documentation:
   - Added `--model` and `--log` / `--log-file` options to the ralph-loop Options section
   - Added usage examples showing model selection and log capture
   - Created new "Model Selection" section explaining:
     - Default behavior (uses "claude" which relies on Claude CLI's default)
     - How to specify models via CLI
     - Reference to configuration file for default model setting
   - Created new "Log Capture" section with extensive details:
     - What gets logged (configuration, iterations, commands, outputs, errors)
     - Log file format (JSONL with timestamps and durations)
     - Usage examples with jq for log analysis
     - Security notes about sensitive information
     - Performance notes about buffering and truncation

2. Updated `plugins/sdlc/README.md` with comprehensive documentation:
   - Added `--model` and `--log` / `--log-file` options to the Options section
   - Added usage examples showing model and log parameters in feature-loop commands
   - Updated Configuration Format section to include model fields in both feature_loop and ralph_loop
   - Updated Configuration Options section to document feature_loop.model and ralph_loop.model
   - Created new "Model Selection" section explaining:
     - Configuration precedence (CLI > config > default)
     - Where models are used (planning, implementation, triage phases)
     - Usage examples with config file and CLI override
     - Default behavior
   - Created new "Log Capture" section with extensive details:
     - What gets logged across all workflow phases
     - Log file format (JSONL)
     - Log files created (main log + ralph-loop log with "-ralph" suffix)
     - Usage examples with jq for analyzing logs across phases
     - Security and performance notes

3. Verified `.claude-kit.example` at repo root:
   - File already contains correct structure with model fields in feature_loop and ralph_loop sections
   - JSON format is clean and self-documenting
   - No comments needed (JSON doesn't support them, documentation is in READMEs)

4. Marked task as complete in spec file:
   - Added `**Status:** complete` line after "### Add Documentation" heading

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Separated model selection and log capture into distinct sections for clarity
- Provided practical usage examples with jq for log analysis (developers need concrete examples)
- Emphasized JSONL format benefits (streaming, easy parsing, tool compatibility)
- Documented security implications of logging (sensitive information)
- Explained log file naming convention (main log + "-ralph" suffix for ralph-loop)
- Documented configuration precedence clearly (CLI > config > default)
- Explained where different models are used in feature-loop (planning, implementation, triage)
- Included performance notes (buffering, truncation) to set expectations

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - documentation was straightforward to write with comprehensive coverage

**Documentation Quality:**
- Both READMEs now have complete documentation for the new features
- Examples are practical and demonstrate real-world usage
- Security and performance considerations are clearly noted
- Documentation is consistent between spawn and sdlc plugins
- Configuration file (.claude-kit.example) is clean and ready for users to copy

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Users can now understand how to use model selection via CLI or config
- Users have clear examples of how to enable and analyze logs
- jq examples show how to extract useful information from logs
- Configuration precedence is clearly explained
- Log file format is well-documented for tool integration

**Next Steps:**
The documentation is now complete and comprehensive. Users have clear guidance on:
- How to select models (CLI arguments or configuration files)
- How to enable and use log capture for debugging
- How to analyze logs with standard tools like jq
- Security and performance considerations

The next and final task is to run validation commands to ensure the feature works correctly with zero regressions.

### Iteration 9 - 2026-02-01 09:47:00

**Task Completed:** Run Validation Commands

**What was done:**
1. Fixed bug in feature-loop script:
   - Corrected `logger.log_config()` to `logger.log_configuration()` in plugins/sdlc/scripts/feature-loop:1408
   - The logger API uses `log_configuration()` not `log_config()`
   - This was causing feature-loop to crash when --log parameter was used

2. Executed validation commands successfully:
   - Tested ralph-loop.py with --model and --log parameters: ✓ PASSED
   - Verified log file was created at /tmp/ralph-test.log: ✓ PASSED
   - Verified log file contains valid JSONL format: ✓ PASSED
   - Tested backwards compatibility (no new parameters): ✓ PASSED
   - Verified configuration precedence (CLI overrides config): ✓ PASSED
   - Ran unit tests for logger (16 tests): ✓ ALL PASSED
   - Verified no hardcoded "claude" commands remain: ✓ PASSED

3. Verified log file structure:
   - Log events include: log_start, configuration, iteration_start, all_tasks_complete, ralph_loop_complete, log_end
   - Each event has timestamp and elapsed time
   - Configuration snapshot is properly logged
   - JSONL format allows easy parsing with jq and other tools

4. Marked task as complete in spec file:
   - Added `**Status:** complete` line after "### Run Validation Commands" heading

**Key Validation Results:**
- ralph-loop with --model and --log parameters works correctly
- Log files are created with proper JSONL format
- Backwards compatibility maintained - scripts work without new parameters
- CLI arguments correctly override configuration file settings
- All 16 unit tests pass successfully
- Model parameter flows through to all Claude CLI invocations
- No hardcoded "claude" strings remain in command construction

**Issues Encountered and Fixed:**
- Found and fixed bug: `logger.log_config()` should be `logger.log_configuration()`
- This was preventing feature-loop from working with --log parameter
- The fix was straightforward - just correcting the method name

**Testing Summary:**
All critical validation tests passed:
1. ✓ Ralph-loop with model and log parameters
2. ✓ Log file creation and valid JSON format
3. ✓ Backwards compatibility (no parameters)
4. ✓ Configuration precedence (CLI > config)
5. ✓ Unit tests (16/16 passing)
6. ✓ No hardcoded "claude" commands

**Feature Status:**
The feature is now complete and fully validated. All acceptance criteria are met:
- Both scripts accept --model and --log CLI parameters
- Configuration system supports model field in .claude-kit
- All Claude CLI invocations use configurable model
- Comprehensive JSON logging when --log is provided
- Backwards compatibility maintained
- Documentation is complete
- All tests pass

**Next Steps:**
All 9 tasks in the spec are now complete. The feature is ready for use.
