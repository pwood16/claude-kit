### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 09:23:37

**Task Completed:** Create Shared Logging Infrastructure

**What was done:**
1. Created `plugins/spawn/lib/` directory structure
2. Implemented `plugins/spawn/lib/logger.py` with comprehensive `StructuredLogger` class:
   - JSON-based logging (JSONL format - one JSON object per line)
   - Core methods: `log_event()`, `log_iteration_start()`, `log_iteration_end()`, `log_command()`, `log_error()`
   - Automatic timestamp generation in ISO 8601 format
   - Elapsed time tracking from logger initialization
   - Context manager support (`timing_context()`) for automatic duration tracking
   - Thread-safe file writing using threading.Lock
   - Output truncation for large command outputs (>1MB)
   - Configuration snapshot logging capability
   - Unicode handling
3. Created comprehensive unit tests in `plugins/spawn/lib/test_logger.py`:
   - 16 test cases covering all core functionality
   - Tests for thread safety with concurrent writes
   - Tests for large output truncation
   - Tests for timing context manager (success and exception paths)
   - Tests for unicode handling
   - All tests pass successfully
4. Created `plugins/spawn/lib/__init__.py` to make it a proper Python package
5. Copied logger files to `plugins/sdlc/lib/` (used copy instead of symlink for simplicity)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used JSONL format (one JSON object per line) for easy streaming and parsing with tools like jq
- Implemented automatic output truncation at 1MB to prevent memory issues with large command outputs
- Used threading.Lock for thread-safe writes to support potential concurrent usage
- Added both timestamp and elapsed time to each event for flexible time analysis
- Created context manager for timing blocks to ensure duration is always captured even on exceptions
- Used Path objects from pathlib for cross-platform file operations
- Added `ensure_ascii=False` to json.dump to properly handle unicode characters

**Issues Encountered:**
- Initial test tearDown had an issue with nested directory cleanup (test_create_parent_directories)
- Fixed by importing shutil and using shutil.rmtree() instead of os.rmdir() to handle nested directories

**Testing Results:**
- All 16 unit tests pass successfully
- Test coverage includes: initialization, event logging, iteration logging, command logging, error logging, timing contexts, configuration logging, thread safety, unicode handling, and edge cases

**Next Steps:**
The logging infrastructure is now complete and ready to be integrated into ralph-loop and feature-loop scripts. The next task is to extend the configuration system to support the model parameter.

### Iteration 2 - 2026-02-01 09:26:52

**Task Completed:** Extend Configuration System

**What was done:**
1. Updated `.claude-kit.example` file to include model field in both `feature_loop` and `ralph_loop` sections:
   - Added `"model": "claude"` to feature_loop configuration
   - Added new `ralph_loop` section with `"model": "claude"` field
   - This provides clear documentation for users on how to configure model selection

2. Extended feature-loop configuration validation in `plugins/sdlc/scripts/feature-loop`:
   - Added validation for `feature_loop.model` field (must be non-empty string)
   - Added validation for `ralph_loop.model` field (must be non-empty string)
   - Updated `validate_config()` to return three-tuple: (feature_loop_config, acr_config, ralph_loop_config)
   - Added validation for ralph_loop config section as dict type

3. Updated configuration loading in feature-loop:
   - Modified `load_configuration()` to return ralph_loop_config as third tuple element
   - Updated main() to extract `default_model` from feature_loop_config with fallback to "claude"
   - Updated verbose logging to include model configuration
   - Updated all call sites to handle three-tuple return value

4. Added comprehensive TypedDict type hints:
   - Created `FeatureLoopConfig` TypedDict with fields: model, max_implement_iterations, max_review_iterations, skip_review, verbose
   - Created `RalphLoopConfig` TypedDict with field: model
   - Created `ACRConfig` TypedDict with field: num_reviewers
   - Used `total=False` to make all fields optional (supporting partial configs)
   - Updated function signatures for `validate_config()` and `load_configuration()` to use these types

5. Updated spec file to mark task as complete:
   - Added `**Status:** complete` line after "### Extend Configuration System" heading

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Used `total=False` in TypedDict definitions to allow partial configurations (all fields optional)
- Maintained backwards compatibility by keeping "claude" as the default model when not configured
- Added validation to ensure model values are non-empty strings (prevents configuration errors)
- Separated ralph_loop config as its own section (not nested under feature_loop) for clarity
- Made ralph_loop_config available throughout feature-loop for future integration with ralph-loop invocations

**Issues Encountered:**
- None - implementation was straightforward

**Testing Considerations:**
- Configuration loading should now properly parse and validate model fields
- Type hints will help catch configuration errors at development time
- Defaults ensure backwards compatibility when model is not specified
- Validation prevents empty or invalid model strings

**Next Steps:**
The configuration system now supports model selection for both feature-loop and ralph-loop. The next task is to update ralph-loop CLI arguments to accept --model and --log parameters.
