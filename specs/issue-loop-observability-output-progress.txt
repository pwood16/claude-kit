### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01

**Task:** Step 1: Add output formatting utilities to ralph-loop

**What was done:**
- Added comprehensive output formatting utilities to ralph-loop script
- Implemented `supports_ansi_colors()` to detect terminal color support
- Added `Colors` class with ANSI color codes (green, yellow, red, blue, cyan, magenta)
- Implemented `color()` function to apply colors conditionally based on terminal support
- Added `format_timestamp()` for consistent timestamp formatting
- Created `create_visual_separator()` for section dividers
- Implemented `format_iteration_summary()` that takes structured data and returns formatted summary text
- Summary includes: iteration number, timestamp, task info, file changes (added/modified/deleted), errors, and overall status
- Color coding: green for success/complete, yellow for warnings/incomplete, red for errors/failures
- Added limits to prevent overwhelming output (max 5 files per category shown)

**Key decisions:**
- Respect NO_COLOR environment variable and non-TTY output (disable colors when piped)
- Use consistent 70-character width for separators
- Limit displayed files to 5 per category with "... and N more" indicators
- Use Unicode symbols (✓, ○, !) for better visual scanning

**Status:** Complete - All formatting utilities are in place and ready to be used by iteration summary generation
