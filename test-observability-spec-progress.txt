**Task Completed:** Step 1: Create a test file

**What was done:**
- Created test-observability-spec.md file with initial spec structure
- Created test-observability-file.txt with content "Hello from test"
- Marked Step 1 as complete in the spec file

**Files Modified:**
- Created: test-observability-spec.md
- Created: test-observability-file.txt

**Learnings:**
- The spec file didn't exist initially, so I created it with a simple test structure
- Successfully completed the first task by creating the requested test file
- The file creation and marking as complete workflow works as expected

**Status:** Step 1 complete - ready for next iteration

Status: Completed
