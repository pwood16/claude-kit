### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 08:12:43

**Tasks Completed:**
1. Created the hello.py script structure
2. Implemented the hello function
3. Added CLI interface
4. Made the script executable
5. Ran all validation commands

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `/Users/cabewaldrop/dev/claude-kit/scripts/hello.py` following the uv inline script pattern used in the project
- Added proper shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`
- Included inline script metadata block with Python version requirement and empty dependencies list
- Implemented `hello()` function with docstring that prints 'Hello World' using `print('Hello World')`
- Added `main()` function with argparse for CLI interface supporting `--help` flag
- Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to invoke main()
- Made script executable with `chmod +x scripts/hello.py`

**Validation Results:**
All validation commands passed successfully:
- Script created and is executable (-rwxr-xr-x permissions)
- Python syntax is valid (py_compile succeeded)
- Help output displays correctly
- Python execution outputs "Hello World" correctly
- Direct execution (`./scripts/hello.py`) works
- UV execution (`uv run --script scripts/hello.py`) works

**Issues Encountered:**
None. All tasks completed without errors.

**Learnings:**
- The project uses uv inline script format with `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` shebang
- Script metadata block follows PEP 723 format with `# /// script` delimiters
- All validation commands passed on first attempt, confirming proper implementation
- The pattern from ralph-loop.py was successfully applied to this simpler hello.py script

**Status:**
All tasks from the spec have been completed successfully. All validation commands passed with zero errors.
Status: Completed
