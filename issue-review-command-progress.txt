### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 10:09:01

**Task Completed:** Step 1 - Create the review-loop script

**What was done:**
- Created `/Users/cabewaldrop/dev/claude-kit/plugins/sdlc/scripts/review-loop` as a Python script using uv
- Added proper shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`
- Added uv script header with requires-python and empty dependencies array
- Implemented comprehensive argument parsing with argparse including:
  - `--max-iterations`/`-m` (default: 5)
  - `--num-reviewers`/`-r` (default: 5)
  - `--model` (default: "claude")
  - `--verbose`/`-v` flag
  - `--log`/`--log-file` for log output
- Made script executable with `chmod +x`
- Tested help output and basic execution
- Marked Step 1 as complete in spec

**Learnings:**
- The review-loop script follows the same pattern as feature-loop with uv script format
- argparse provides clean help output with examples via epilog parameter
- Script correctly inherits Python 3.10+ requirement like feature-loop
- All arguments have sensible defaults matching the feature spec requirements
- The script skeleton is ready for implementation of core logic in subsequent steps

**Issues encountered:**
None. Step completed successfully.

**Next steps:**
- Step 2: Implement configuration loading in review-loop
Status: Completed
