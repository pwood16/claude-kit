# Bug Planning

Create a new plan to resolve the `Bug` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan.

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: You're writing a plan to resolve a bug based on the `Bug` that will add value to the application.
- IMPORTANT: The `Bug` describes the bug that will be resolved but remember we're not resolving the bug, we're creating the plan that will be used to resolve the bug based on the `Plan Format` below.
- You're writing a plan to resolve a bug, it should be thorough and precise so we fix the root cause and prevent regressions.
- Create the plan in the `specs/` directory with filename: `bug-{descriptive-name}.md`
  - Replace `{descriptive-name}` with a short, descriptive name based on the bug (e.g., "fix-login-error", "resolve-timeout", "patch-memory-leak")
- Use the plan format below to create the plan.
- Research the codebase to understand the bug, reproduce it, and put together a plan to fix it.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to fix the bug.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the bug, its root cause, and the steps to fix it properly.
- IMPORTANT: Be surgical with your bug fix, solve the bug at hand and don't fall off track.
- IMPORTANT: We want the minimal number of changes that will fix and address the bug.
- Don't use decorators. Keep it simple.
- If you need a new library, use `uv add` and be sure to report it in the `Notes` section of the `Plan Format`.
- IMPORTANT: If the bug affects the UI or user interactions:
  - Add a task in the `Step by Step Tasks` section to create a separate E2E test to prevent future regressions
  - Add E2E test validation to your Validation Commands section
  - To be clear, we're not creating a new E2E test file, we're creating a task to create a new E2E test file in the `Plan Format` below
- Respect requested files in the `Relevant Files` section.
- Start your research by reading the `README.md` file.

## Plan Format

```md
# Bug: <bug name>

## Bug Description
<describe the bug in detail, including symptoms and expected vs actual behavior>

## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem that needs to be solved>

## Solution Statement
<describe the proposed solution approach to fix the bug>

## Steps to Reproduce
<list exact steps to reproduce the bug>

## Root Cause Analysis
<analyze and explain the root cause of the bug>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to fix the bug. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required to fix the bug then move on to the specific changes required to fix the bug. Include tests that will validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions.>


## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions.

<list commands you'll use to validate with 100% confidence the bug is fixed with zero regressions. every command must execute without errors so be specific about what you want to run to validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions. Include commands to reproduce the bug before and after the fix.>

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes or context that are relevant to the bug that will be helpful to the developer>
```

## Bug
Extract the bug details from the prompt

## Report
- Summarize the work you've just done in a concise bullet point list.
- Include the full path to the plan file you created (e.g., `specs/issue-fix-login-error.md`)
