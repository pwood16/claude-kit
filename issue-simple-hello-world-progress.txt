### Iteration 1 - 2026-02-01 08:41:17

**Tasks Completed:**
1. Created scripts/simple_hello.py with complete implementation
2. Added proper shebang: #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
3. Added uv script metadata block with Python >=3.10 requirement
4. Implemented simple_hello() function that prints 'Hello World'
5. Added argparse-based CLI interface with --help support
6. Made script executable with chmod +x
7. Validated all execution methods (python3, direct, uv)

**Implementation Details:**
- Followed the exact pattern from scripts/hello.py for consistency
- Used proper type hints (-> None) for all functions
- Added comprehensive docstrings at module and function level
- All validation commands passed successfully:
  - Python syntax valid
  - Script is executable
  - All three execution methods work and produce identical output
  - Help flag displays correctly

**Learnings:**
- All five tasks in the spec were completed in a single iteration since they form a cohesive unit (creating a single file)
- The uv script metadata pattern (# /// script) is crucial for uv compatibility
- Following existing patterns (hello.py) made implementation straightforward
- Validation commands confirmed zero errors across all execution methods

**Status:** All tasks complete. Feature fully implemented and validated.
Status: Completed
